== Description ==
This plugin patches a fix for WooCommerce websites that are affected by the latest version of Google Chrome which seems to think a lot of non-https sites actually have a SSL and redirects the user to a broken https website version.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `chrome-https-woocommerce` plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How does this work? =
The plugin simply tells the browser that the server's site is in fact a http:// website and not a https:// website.
